# Mutex and Channel basics

### What is an atomic operation?
> An operation during which a processor can simultaneously read a location and write it in the same bus operation. This prevents any other processor or I/O device 
from writing or reading memory until the operation is complete.

### What is a semaphore?
> A semaphore is an integer flag with value always greater than or equal to 0
Can be used to signal if a resouce is being used or not.

### What is a mutex?
> A concept of ownership, where one thread owns the mutex and the other threads has t
to wait for the other thread to gie the mutex.

### What is the difference between a mutex and a binary semaphore?
> Binary sempahore waith for the other thread to give a signal. When the signal
is given it does something and unblocks.

### What is a critical section?
> Critical section is the code that shall be run on the resource that the mutex holds.

### What is the difference between race conditions and data races?
 > A race condition is a flaw that occurs when the timing or ordering of events affects a program’s correctness.
A data race happens when two programs or threads access the same memory location and interrrupt each others
read and write operations.
